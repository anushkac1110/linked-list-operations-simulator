# Linked List Operations Simulator (C++)

A menu-driven C++ program that demonstrates the implementation of a
singly linked list using dynamic memory allocation.

---

##  Features
- Insert node at:
  - Beginning
  - End
  - Specific position
- Delete node from:
  - Beginning
  - End
  - Specific position
- Search an element in the list
- Display all elements in the list

---

##  Concepts Used
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Singly linked list structure
- Traversal techniques
- Function-based modular programming
- Menu-driven program design

---

##  Purpose
This project was developed to strengthen understanding of linked list
implementation and pointer manipulation in C++ by building a practical,
interactive program.

---
This project demonstrates core linked list operations using a menu-driven C++ program.

##  How to Run
1. Download the file `linked_list_simulator.cpp`
2. Compile using a C++ compiler:
   g++ linked_list_simulator.cpp -o linkedlist
3. Run the program:
